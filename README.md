# IntuBuilder

 A python PyGame implementation for easing the processes of learning new Algorithms intuitively.

As we all know Learning new algorithms has always been a challenging task for beginners. Let alone grabbing the intuition of how the algorithm works under the hood is an even challenging problem. There are many people who just memorize the algorithms in the start rather than really learning how does it work under the hood, many are never able to develop the intuition for that,

Hence **“IntuBuilder”** is an attempt to solve this exact problem by providing interactive and visual proofs of how an algorithm works underneath the surface along with providing underlying theory and concepts of the various algorithms in a fun and interactive way so that the processes of learning and building intuition of algorithms becomes easier for everybody.

## **Procedure to run:**

- for windows users:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```
- for linux/mac users:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py
    ```
